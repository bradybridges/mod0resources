I have found youtube to be very useful when trying to learn more about command line and configuring my bash_profile. Another resource I have found useful is stackoverflow.

Another thing I forgot to add that I have found very useful is [cheatsheet](https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/).

When getting Sublime set up for my preferences, I found this (article)[https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/sublime-text-plugins-2018] on Shopify useful.
